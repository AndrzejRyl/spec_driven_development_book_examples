## Prompts used to build it


`Prompt 1`

I want to build a simple webpage for my Samoyed dog. He's name is "Whisky" and I would like to have a brief introduction telling everybody what traits he loves and than a carousel of his images. This is a fresh new project so let's start by telling me how to set everything up using reactjs

---
`Prompt 2`

I added 6 images. Where should I change the code to display all of them?

---
`Prompt 3`

works BUT I don't really see images. Slider is extremely wide (going outside of the screen) and I see a blur of colors instead of actual images.

---
`Prompt 4`

can you generate README for this project? EXTREMELY simple and concise. I'm mainly interested to tell people how to run it locally
